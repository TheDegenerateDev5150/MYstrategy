        A use case is a description of a user facing a problem for which we donâ€™t yet have a good solution; that is, a use case is an actual user wanting to do something. See [Sandboxed Filesystem use cases?](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2012JulSep/0835.html) for an example of how to describe use cases and requirements related to a specific problem.
